This is a research paper that our team working on, we got our ideas by thinking "Since it is an era of AI, wouldn't it be nice if we can get the summarization for novel? that's itttt!" and that's how it happen. we were searching for a model and we found that BERT is the most used for text summarization. In BERT, we use BERTSum and PEGASUS method. BERTSum is extractive summarrization where it extract the most important information from the available text and generate the summary based on that information, meanwhile PEGASUS is abstractive summarization where it read all the available text and interpret the summary using it's own words.
